##Advanced Web Design - Schedule
This is just a suggested schedule. Improv shouldn't take up a full half hour and lunch can be cut down if more time is needed for lectures/labs/projects.

**Day 5**
+ 9 - 10:00 ToDo - jQuery Donut (Everyone needs to actually do this because we are going to be building an OO Donut Lab later in the class)
+ 10:00 - 11:00 JS Object Literals
+ 11:00 - 12:00 OO Donut Lab with Object Literals
+ 12:00 - 1:00 Lunch
+ 1:00 - 1:30 Start on OO MadLibs Group Lab
+ 1:30 - 2:00 Improv
+ 2:00 - 2:50 Let students continue to work on OO MadLibs Lab and present if time
